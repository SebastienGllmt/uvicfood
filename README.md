# uvic_food_app
A simple app for displaying whether specific restaurants/cafes at UVIC are open when the user opens the app.
It will check the current time and display a green light if the place is open, and a red light if it is closed.

This is my first attempt at combining Laravel and PHP to create an app so I wanted to start simple.
